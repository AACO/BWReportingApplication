# BWReportingApplication
This application should help group admins track player attendance as well as mission play throughs. It is meant to be coupled with a web facing client (https://github.com/BourbonWarfare/BWWebApplication) to view these stats, as well as manage maps/missions.

If you want to use/modify this application, go ahead. If you have performance/stability improvements please let me know. Please report any bugs you find.
